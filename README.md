# Arc Windows to Firefox / Floorp

**This was a custom modification of ArcWTF with little tweaks, the screenshots in this readme are not updated to reflect the tweaks.**

For you who want to try new, shiny Arc Browser on Windows! No registration needed, compatible for all Windows versions âœ¨

Based on [edge-frfox theme by bmFtZQ](https://github.com/bmFtZQ/edge-frfox) | Vertical tab sidebar setup derived from [arcticfox-theme by Sirlan-ff00ff](https://github.com/sirlan-ff00ff/arcticfox-theme).

<b>July 14</b>: Sorry for not updating this theme and for ignoring messages/concerns. I don't think I'm able to maintain this at least until September/October. I just merged previous pull requests -- please make one if you find a bug/clash with new FF update and I will apply it here. Also, I don't think I will update the Floorp theme for now.

Any suggestions or concerns? [Submit new issues](https://github.com/KiKaraage/ArcWTF/issues/new/choose) or [contact me on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/comments/1acgx8c/arcftw_attempt_to_replicate_arc_browser_sleek/).

## Compability
I modify, made and test this theme on Firefox 123, Windows 10. This theme can work with Linux and MacOS too.

ArcWTF will **clash with the default Firefox system theme**, dark themes that have light toolbar/light URL bar, and light themes with dark toolbar/dark URL bar.

Vertical tabs are currently disabled in Private Browsing Mode due to behaviour clashes with window controls.

<details> 
  <summary>For Floorp, there's several incompability I currently have since it might clashed with several parts of the built-in theme they had, like:</summary>
  
* I haven't been able to modify URL font size
* Userchrome Toggle hasn't working yet, so the vertical tab sidebar is either a) autohidden but you can't toggle it to be in fixed position, or b) can be switched on to be shown/hidden, but it can't be automated.
* Advanced configurations from this theme in about:config doesn't worked, so the sidebar tab (either in Sidebery, TST or their default vertical tab) tend to mimic the window background instead of mimicking tab/toolbar background to blend with the toolbar and browser border. So far I can only fix this in Sidebery - you will have to grab toolbar's hex/RGB color and apply it to `--frame-bg` parameter, as shown in screenshots below.
* Hiding tabs bar, turning on browser border frame is applicable only through Floorp's settings instead of through the theme + about:config configurations.
* Otherwise, the theme are working quite well! Split view is available too, but since the devs haven't put the option in right-click context menu, you will have to use their default vertical tab to do it. Though it doesn't look as good as Sidebery.

## Applying the theme
<b>(1/3) Installing addons and choosing theme</b>
* Install [Sidebery](https://github.com/mbnuqw/sidebery) and [Userchrome Toggle](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/userchrome-toggle/).
* Open `about:addons`, click 'Userchrome Toggle', go to 'Options' tab.
* Disable 'Display a notification', Go to 'Style Toggle 1', put `|| ` in prefix (should also have the ending space) and apply changes.

  ![Userchrome Toggle settings](https://github.com/KiKaraage/ArcWTF/assets/10529881/dde05450-f53b-497f-8107-865289b3be84)
* Click extension button (puzzle icon), right click on Userchrome Toggle icon, click 'Pin to Toolbar'.

  ![Pin to Toolbar](https://github.com/KiKaraage/ArcWTF/assets/10529881/8a72dc0c-7f40-4d34-a3d3-ca9e8820b127)
* Open Sidebery settings, go to the Style Editor and paste the [CSS config](./sidebery-css-style), or go to Help section and click import [my backup JSON file](./sidebery-ArcWTF.json). Go to Navigation Bar settings and add tab panels to use as Spaces to your liking. _Personally I use History panel as the first item to mimic 'Recently closed' button on Arc so applying custom icon on the CSS config would be easier._

 <b>(3/3) How to use this theme?</b>
 * Hover to browser left corner to show the vertical tabs.
 * Right-click navigation toolbar and click 'Customize Toolbar'. Move Userchrome Toggle button to the left position, before back-forward-reload buttons. Put flexible spaces before and after the URL bar. Take a look on screenshots below for guides:
