# FirefoxCSS

My personal Firefox CSS tweaks.

## Update

I stopped maintaining this repository. I'm using [ArcWTF](https://github.com/KiKaraage/ArcWTF/) now.

## How to use

1. Open `about:config` and set `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` to `true`.
2. Open your profile folder and create a folder called `chrome` if it doesn't exist.
3. Copy the contents of this repository to the `chrome` folder.
4. Install sidebery and add the `sidebery.css` to the custom styles.
5. Change the sidebery prefix to `[S]` in the settings.
6. Restart Firefox.
